Javier released an album with Universal’s label Republic Records, called Come Through for You, in 2011.</p><p>However, Javier was disappointed with Republic’s failure to promote the release, and parted ways with the label in 2012. And so began the long tradition of Voice winners cutting ties with Universal.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# class=broken_link>BRYNN CARTELLI, CHEVEL SHEPHERD, AND MORE ‘THE VOICE’ WINNERS BEFORE THYE WERE FAMOUS</a></strong></p><p>Javier said in a statement that his relationship with Universal became a “bad marriage,” despite his “high hopes.” <a href=# class=broken_link>He shared</a>, “But when you pour your heart and soul into a new album that you think is really great, and your label who is supposed to support, market and promote your music does neither, it’s really hard not to be upset. The truth is, we are all better off going our separate ways.”</p><p>Javier went on to tour with his coach’s band Maroon 5, and he signed with the label Concord Music Group in 2014, releasing his next album Gravity in 2016.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cassadee-pope-wanted-more-creative-freedom>Cassadee Pope Wanted More Creative Freedom</h3><p>Cassadee Pope won The Voice Season 3 on Team Blake in 2012, and signed with Universal’s country label Republic Nashville, which later became BMLG Records.
